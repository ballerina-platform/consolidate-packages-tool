# Consolidate-packages bal tool

Ballerina inherently supports microservices-style deployments, which are well-suited for microservice orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
However, many enterprise users deploy on VMs or Docker, where managing each service as a separate process increases complexity and resource overhead. 
This tool aims to provide a solution tailored to such scenarios by enabling consolidated deployments.

## Usage

### Create or update a consolidator package

Create a new package and add the `consolidate-packages` tool entry as shown in the below example into the `Ballerina.toml` with the services required to consolidate. 
You can add/remove services as needed by updating the values provided for the `options.services` array. The tool will be automatically pulled during
the package build.

```toml
[package]
org = "myorg"
name = "myApp"
version = "0.1.0"

[[tool.consolidate-packages]]
id = "consolidateSvc"
options.services = ["myorg/svc1", "myorg/svc2"]
```
Services required for consolidation can be from Ballerina Central, local repository, or both. In addition to the tool entries above, add a dependency entry for locally published packages as shown below:

```toml
[[dependency]]
org = "myorg"
name = "svc1"
version = "1.1.0"
repository = "local"
```

#### Using the CLI tool
Alternatively, the `consolidate-packages` CLI tool can be installed to create and modify the consolidator package. This
is typically useful in CI/CD pipelines.

An example is shown below.

##### Installation

Execute the command below to pull the tool.

```bash
bal tool pull consolidate-packages
```

##### Creating a new consolidator package
```
$ bal consolidate-packages new --package-path=myApp myorg/svc1,myorg/svc2
```

To create a consolidated package with local packages,
```
$ bal consolidate-packages new --package-path hotel-app myorg/order_service,myorg/payment_service --repository=local
```

##### Adding new services to an existing package
Execute the command below to from the package root directory.
```
$ bal consolidate-packages add myorg/svc3,myorg/svc4
```

To add local packages,
```
$ cd hotel-app
$ bal consolidate-packages add myorg/customer_service,myorg/menu_service --repository=local
```


##### Removing services from an existing package
Execute the command below to from the package root directory.
```
$ bal consolidate-packages remove myorg/svc2,myorg/svc3
```

2. Export GitHub Personal access token with read package permissions as follows,
   ```bash
   export packageUser=<Username>
   export packagePAT=<Personal access token>
   ```

### Building the Source

Execute the commands below to build from the source.

1. To build the library:

        ./gradlew clean build

2. To run tests:

        ./gradlew clean test

3. To build the module without the checks (including tests):

        ./gradlew clean build -x check

4. To publish to maven local:

        ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal

5. Publish the generated artifacts to the Ballerina local repository:

        ./gradlew clean build -PpublishToLocalCentral=true

6. Publish the generated artifacts to the Ballerina central repository:

        ./gradlew clean build -PpublishToCentral=true
